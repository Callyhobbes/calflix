# Welcome to Calflix

This project was inspired by my love of Netflix and wanting to emulate the user experience.

## What did I use?

This project was created using reactJS, along with html and css. All of the film content is pulled via the movie database (https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to pull hundred of movies and tv shows into the page. Trailers are pulled from Youtube via the react-youtube and movie-trailer modules.

## How do I use this?

After the preloader runs, you can click the icon to take you to the main page, with a list of the top movies and tv shows.

If you hover over them, you can see the title and if clicked, you can view the trailer (there are some issues pulling the trailer of tv shows currently)

## Fixes

I'm trying to solve the issue of tv shows not being able to pull with the module react-youtube and movie-trailer. I also plan add some carousel functionality for desktops.

## What next?

I'm looking to add some additional functionality like a search bar, user authentication, etc.

If you have any thoughts, I would love to hear!
